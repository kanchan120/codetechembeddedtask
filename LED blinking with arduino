1. When the program starts:

The setup() function configures pin 13 as an output.



2. During the loop():

The LED connected to pin 13 is turned ON (HIGH) for 1 second.

The LED is then turned OFF (LOW) for 1 second.

This process repeats continuously.




Output Timeline:

1. Second 0: The LED turns ON.


2. Second 1: The LED turns OFF.


3. Second 2: The LED turns ON again.


4. Second 3: The LED turns OFF again.


5. The cycle continues indefinitely.
