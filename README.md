Overview of the project
project 1 : LED BLINKING WITH ARDUINO
To accomplish the task of blinking an LED with an Arduino, follow these steps:


---

Materials Needed:

1. Arduino board (e.g., Uno, Nano, or Mega)


2. An LED


3. 220-ohm resistor (to limit current)


4. Breadboard


5. Jumper wires


6. USB cable to connect Arduino to your computer







---

Circuit Setup:

1. Connect the longer leg (anode) of the LED to a digital pin (e.g., pin 13) on the Arduino board.


2. Connect the shorter leg (cathode) of the LED to one end of the 220-ohm resistor.


3. Connect the other end of the resistor to the ground (GND) pin of the Arduino.




---

Code for LED Blinking:

Here's a simple Arduino program (sketch) to blink an LED at a 1-second interval:

// Pin where the LED is connected
const int ledPin = 13;

void setup() {
  // Initialize the LED pin as an output
  pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  // Turn the LED on
  digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH);
  delay(1000); // Wait for 1 second

  // Turn the LED off
  digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);
  delay(1000); // Wait for 1 second
}


---

Steps to Upload the Code:

1. Open the Arduino IDE on your computer.


2. Copy and paste the code above into the IDE.


3. Connect your Arduino board to your computer using the USB cable.


4. Select the appropriate board and port from the Tools menu in the Arduino IDE.


5. Click the Upload button to transfer the code to the Arduino.




---

Expected Output:

The LED will blink on and off with a 1-second interval.

If you want to change the blinking interval, modify the value in the delay() function. For example, delay(500); will create a half-second interval.

PROJECT 2 : HOME AUTOMATION SYSTEM WITH RASPBERRY PI
TO CREATE THE FLASK -BASED WEB SERVER TO CONTROL THE GPIO PINS 
CREATE THE WEB INTERFACE 
Creating a home automation system with a Raspberry Pi involves integrating hardware, software, and a control interface to manage appliances. Below are the detailed steps for implementing this project:


---

Materials Needed:

1. Raspberry Pi (any model with GPIO pins, e.g., Raspberry Pi 4, 3, or Zero W)


2. MicroSD card (16 GB or larger) with Raspberry Pi OS installed


3. Relays (to control high-power appliances like lights or fans)


4. Jumper wires


5. Breadboard (optional)


6. A Wi-Fi-enabled network


7. Appliances (e.g., light bulbs, fans, or other devices)


8. Power supply for Raspberry Pi


9. (Optional) USB or HDMI accessories for setup, or SSH for headless configuration




---

Overview of the System:

1. Raspberry Pi: Acts as the central controller.


2. Relay Module: Interfaces the Raspberry Pi with high-power appliances.


3. Control Interface: Web-based or mobile app for remote control.


4. Software: Python scripts for GPIO control, a web server (e.g., Flask or Node.js), and a database (optional).




---

Step 1: Set Up Raspberry Pi

1. Install Raspberry Pi OS using Raspberry Pi Imager.


2. Enable SSH and GPIO by navigating to Raspberry Pi Configuration.


3. Connect your Raspberry Pi to your Wi-Fi network.




---

Step 2: Hardware Setup

1. Connect the relay module to the Raspberry Pi GPIO pins:

VCC to Raspberry Pi 5V pin

GND to Raspberry Pi GND pin

IN1 to a GPIO pin (e.g., GPIO17)



2. Connect an appliance (e.g., a light bulb) to the relay's terminal:

One wire connects to the relay's NO (Normally Open) terminal.

The other connects to the appliance's power supply.




Warning: When working with high voltage, exercise caution and consult an expert if unsure.


---

Step 3: Install Required Software

1. Update your Raspberry Pi:

sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade


2. Install Python and Flask:

sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
pip3 install flask




---

Step 4: Write a Python Script

Create a Python script (app.py) to control the GPIO and serve the web interface.

from flask import Flask, render_template, request
import RPi.GPIO as GPIO

app = Flask(_name_)

# GPIO setup
GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)
relay
